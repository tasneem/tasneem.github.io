					<p class="welcome">Senior Editor, NPR's Code Switch. I edit long essays about uncomfortable issues: race, ethnicity, and identity.
Formerly led the data journalism team at Mother Jones, and spoke regularly at fancy conferences about how small, lean newsroom teams can punch way above their weight.
Even more formerly was a <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/boy-wonder/Content?oid=919823">longform</a> <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/born-bad/Content?oid=921356">features</a> <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-aging-of-the-moors/Content?oid=999633">writer</a> on staff at the Chicago Reader, the best alt-weekly in the world.
Author of the essay <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">Is Coding The New Literacy?</a> (Mother Jones, 2014), hailed as required reading on the future of programming.</p>

          <h4>Senior Digital Editor, NPR's Code Switch</h4>
          <h5>2015-present</h5>
          <p>I just started this gig, and so far, so good. Stay tuned :)</p>

          <h4>Interactive Editor, Mother Jones</h4>
          <h5>2011-2015</h5>
          <p>I'm the editor of an award-winning team of digital reporters and producers that punches well above its weight. Our team has reported hundreds of stories across key beats while constantly experimenting with and refining online presentation of our content, from <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/special-reports/2012/12/guns-in-america-mass-shootings">enterprise packages</a> and breaking-news <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-michael-brown-ferguson-black-men">folos</a> to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/back-line-green-card-immigration-reform-quiz">visual</a> <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/ferguson-might-have-break-its-habit-hitting-poor-people-big-fines">explainers</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=calculator%20mother%20jones">interactive calculators</a>. Read more about our work <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/06/07/tasneem-raja-on-growing-an-interactive-news-team-skill-sharing-and-smart-approaches-to-data/">here</a> and <a href="http://towcenter.org/blog/tasneem-raja-urges-newsrooms-to-adopt-pair-programming-for-better-data-journalism/">here</a>.

          <p>I work with the rest of our highly talented senior editorial staff in crafting overall digital strategy and learning from traffic analytics and audience engagement metrics. I've also created a popular company-wide skills-sharing series, led an overhaul of digital storytelling workflows across the newsroom, and served as a desk editor during several major breaking news events.</p>
          <p>As an editor and reporter, I have deep interest and background in issues of identity and inclusion. My 7,000-word <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">feature</a> on diversity in computer science has been called the definitive take on the subject. A story I assigned and edited on <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2012/01/sweden-still-forcing-sterilization">transgender rights in Sweden</a> was cited as influential on subsequent policy change. My 2012 <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/04/silicon-valley-brogrammer-culture-sexist-sxsw">story</a> on "brogrammer" culture in Silicon Valley broke open the conversation on tech's gender problem. Fast Company called me "one of the smartest people on Twitter" for my commentary on issues of diversity and identity.</p>
          
          <h4>Web Producer, The Bay Citizen</h4>
          <h5>2010-2011</h5>
          <p>Cutting-edge interactive designer and editor of award-winning multimedia journalism on deadline. Led the development of several data-driven enterprise projects, including a government salary database and a road safety tracker.</p>

          <h4>Reporter, The Chicago Reader</h4>
          <h5>2005-2008</h5>
          <p>Metro reporter with a focus on subcultures and marginalized groups. Wrote numerous enterprise features and greatly increased the Reader's online presence via our culture blog.</p>
