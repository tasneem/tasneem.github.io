					<p class="welcome">Tasneem comes to us from Mother Jones, where, as a senior editor with a focus on data-driven journalism, she currently leads an award-winning team of digital reporters and producers who push the boundaries of storytelling on the web. Before Mother Jones, Tasneem was part of the impressive, multi-everything launch team of the Bay Citizen, a non-profit reporting startup in San Francisco, which partnered with the New York Times to amplify Bay Area media coverage.

Called “one of the smartest people on Twitter” by Fast Company, Tasneem is a leading voice in the conversation on gender, race, and tech culture. Her viral exposé on "brogrammer" culture in Silicon Valley exploded the conversation on tech's gender problem and remains a must-read. Tasneem began her journalism career in 2005 as a metro reporter for the Chicago Reader, reporting on subcultures and marginalized communities. She was a pioneering student in the multi-media storytelling program at UC Berkeley School of Journalism, where she earned her master’s degree.

As a multi-skilled journalist, Tasneem is a knock-out. She’s a deft and insightful reporter, writer and editor. She loves storytelling and the dazzling array of forms it can take. She’s skilled at moving ideas to the right platforms in the right ways. She codes. She builds. She shares. She mentors. And she has an intricate knowledge of – and passion for - the media space around race, ethnicity, culture and identity.

We wanted to keep her in the building and never let her go as soon as we met her. But we agreed to wait until Jan 26, when she will join us full time. We know you’ll love her and that the entire newsroom will benefit from her talents. There is a great May 2014 interview she did with Columbia’s Tow Center for Journalism that provides a solid peek into what makes her tick. Here's a taste:

“We live by a few guiding principles on my team. The big one is that it’s our job to make sure everybody in the newsroom can tell a story by any means necessary. That is, reporters should know how to map, the mapmaking pros on my team should know how to factcheck, the fact checkers should know when to use a column chart versus a bar chart, and so on. We don’t believe in siloed skills….Of course, some folks will always be way better at some skills than others, but you gotta pay it forward, which brings me to our second guiding principle: we are all learners, and we are all teachers.”</p>
          <small>Also, a fun person.</small>

          <h4>Senior Digital Editor, NPR's Code Switch</h4>

          <p>I just started this gig, and so far, so good. Stay tuned :)</p>

          <h4>Interactive Editor, Mother Jones</h4>
          <h5>2011-2015</h5>
          <p>I'm the editor of an award-winning team of digital reporters and producers that punches well above its weight. Our team has reported hundreds of stories across key beats while constantly experimenting with and refining online presentation of our content, from <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/special-reports/2012/12/guns-in-america-mass-shootings">enterprise packages</a> and breaking-news <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-michael-brown-ferguson-black-men">folos</a> to <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/back-line-green-card-immigration-reform-quiz">visual</a> <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/ferguson-might-have-break-its-habit-hitting-poor-people-big-fines">explainers</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=calculator%20mother%20jones">interactive calculators</a>. Read more about our work <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/06/07/tasneem-raja-on-growing-an-interactive-news-team-skill-sharing-and-smart-approaches-to-data/">here</a> and <a href="http://towcenter.org/blog/tasneem-raja-urges-newsrooms-to-adopt-pair-programming-for-better-data-journalism/">here</a>.

          <p>I work with the rest of our highly talented senior editorial staff in crafting overall digital strategy and learning from traffic analytics and audience engagement metrics. I've also created a popular company-wide skills-sharing series, led an overhaul of digital storytelling workflows across the newsroom, and served as a desk editor during several major breaking news events.</p>
          <p>As an editor and reporter, I have deep interest and background in issues of identity and inclusion. My 7,000-word <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">feature</a> on diversity in computer science has been called the definitive take on the subject. A story I assigned and edited on <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2012/01/sweden-still-forcing-sterilization">transgender rights in Sweden</a> was cited as influential on subsequent policy change. My 2012 <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/04/silicon-valley-brogrammer-culture-sexist-sxsw">story</a> on "brogrammer" culture in Silicon Valley broke open the conversation on tech's gender problem. Fast Company called me "one of the smartest people on Twitter" for my commentary on issues of diversity and identity.</p>
